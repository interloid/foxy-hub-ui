  --   — the write-side twin of the read leak fixed in `06_rls_deliveries`.
  -- Scoping the SELECT alone would have left this open, since a caller only needs the id.

  -- `p_project_id` is now actually used: it was accepted and ignored, so a caller could
  -- pass anything. Requiring it to match the delivery's own project makes a mismatched
  -- pair fail instead of silently succeeding.
